# Technical Course Final Project

This repository contains the final project developed for the completion of my Technical course in Information Technology for the Internet at IFSUL.

## Title
SafePet – Web platform for registering animals for adoption, lost, and found.

## Abstract
This project presents the development of a web platform designed to facilitate the adoption, search, and registration of lost and found animals. Its primary goal is to connect individuals seeking to adopt pets with those offering animals for adoption, while also assisting in the recovery of lost pets by allowing users to register found or missing animals.

The platform was built using Node.js with the Express.js framework for the backend, and MySQL as the database management system. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, and Bootstrap to deliver a simple, functional, and user-friendly interface.

Key features include the registration of animals for adoption, lost, or found; as well as a filtering system by state, city, species, and gender—enabling a faster and more efficient search experience. Overall, the project contributes to animal welfare by promoting adoption and improving the chances of reuniting lost pets with their owners.
